## Introduction

[Tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/paper.html) is a collection of R packages that provide useful functions for common tasks in data science, including data import, tidying, manipulation, visualization, and programming.

![](https://github.com/alexandersimon1/Data607/blob/main/Tidyverse%20CREATE/tidyverse_overview.png?raw=true){width="50%"}

Packages for each of these tasks include:

-   Import: [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for reading files in various formats

-   Tidy: [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for tidying data

-   Transformation: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and its related packages (eg, [stringr](stringr) for strings, [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) for factors, [lubridate](lubridate) for date and time)

-   Visualization: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for plots

-   Programming: [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) for tibbles, [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) for the `%>%` pipe operator

Here, I demonstrate how to use the `across()` function from the `dplyr` package with a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ryanair-reviews-ratings) of airline passenger reviews of Ryanair, a low-cost airline in Europe.

<br>

## Data

Data were [downloaded](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ryanair-reviews-ratings) from Kaggle as a CSV file, pushed to a GitHub repository, and then read in.

```{r read-data, message=FALSE}
ryanair_reviews_raw <- read_csv('https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/alexandersimon1/Data607/main/Tidyverse%20CREATE/ryanair_reviews.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r glimpse-raw-data, include=FALSE}
glimpse(ryanair_reviews_raw)
```

```{r tidy-data, include=FALSE}
# Basic tidying
# Rename columns and select informative columns
ryanair_reviews <- ryanair_reviews_raw %>%
  select(Date_publish = `Date Published`, 
         Comment_title = `Comment title`, 
         Comment, 
         Rating_seat_comfort = `Seat Comfort`,
         Rating_service_cabin = `Cabin Staff Service`, 
         Rating_food = `Food & Beverages`, 
         Rating_service_ground = `Ground Service`, 
         Rating_entertainment = `Inflight Entertainment`, 
         Rating_wifi = `Wifi & Connectivity`, 
         Rating_value = `Value For Money`, 
         Rating_overall = `Overall Rating`, 
         Recommended, 
         Flight_date = `Date Flown`, 
         Origin, Destination, Aircraft, 
         Traveler_type = `Type Of Traveller`,
         Seat_type = `Seat Type`, 
         Trip_verified)
```

This is what the data look like:[^1]

## What is the purpose of [across()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html)?

R is optimized for operations over columns. `across()` simplifies the application of a function to mulitple columns. Although `across()` can be implemented in other ways, using it results in cleaner, more concise, and more scalable code.

<br>

## Usage

`across(.cols, .fns, ..., .names = NULL, .unpack = FALSE)`

Arguments:

-   `.cols` - The columns of the dataframe to transform. Columns can be specified explicitly or by a range (eg, `c(x:z)` for columns 'x', 'y', and 'z')

-   `.fns` - The function(s) to be applied to each column specified in `.cols`

-   `.names` - Rule(s) to customize the names of new columns resulting from the functions specified in `.fns`

-   `.unpack` - Expand compressed columns when TRUE. See tidyr documentation for `pack()` and `unpack()` for more information

<br>

## Examples

### Example 1. Calculate the mean rating of each rating category

*Without across() - A separate command is needed for each rating. The code is repetitive, hard to read, and prone to errors (eg, typos).*

```{r mean-ratings-without-across}
ryanair_reviews %>%
  summarise(
    Rating_seat_comfort_mean = round(mean(Rating_seat_comfort, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_service_cabin_mean = round(mean(Rating_service_cabin, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_food_mean = round(mean(Rating_food, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_service_ground_mean = round(mean(Rating_service_ground, na.rm = TRUE), 2),    
    Rating_entertainment_mean = round(mean(Rating_entertainment, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_wifi_mean = round(mean(Rating_wifi, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_value_mean = round(mean(Rating_value, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    Rating_overall_mean = round(mean(Rating_overall, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
  ) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

<br>

*With across() - The code is much simpler, regardless of the number of columns.*

```{r mean-ratings-with-across}
ryanair_reviews %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols = starts_with("Rating"),
      .fns = ~ round(mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 2),  # ".x" is a placeholder for the column
      .names = "{col}_mean"  # append "_mean" to each column name
    )
  ) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

<br>

### Example 2. Determine the minimum and maximum rating of each rating category

The `.fns` argument of `across()` can have mulitple functions.

*Without across() - Again, the code block is long and repetitive.*

```{r min-max-ratings-without-across}
ryanair_reviews %>%
  summarise(
    Rating_seat_comfort_min = min(Rating_seat_comfort, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_seat_comfort_max = max(Rating_seat_comfort, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_service_cabin_min = min(Rating_service_cabin, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_service_cabin_max = max(Rating_service_cabin, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_food_min = min(Rating_food, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_food_max = max(Rating_food, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_service_ground_min = min(Rating_service_ground, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_service_ground_max = max(Rating_service_ground, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_entertainment_min = min(Rating_entertainment, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_entertainment_max = max(Rating_entertainment, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_wifi_min = min(Rating_wifi, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_wifi_max = max(Rating_wifi, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_value_min = min(Rating_value, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_value_max = max(Rating_value, na.rm = TRUE),    
    Rating_overall_min = min(Rating_overall, na.rm = TRUE),
    Rating_overall_max = max(Rating_overall, na.rm = TRUE)   
  ) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

<br>

*With across() - The code is much simpler and easily scalable to more columns and/or functions.*

```{r min-max-ratings-with-across}
ryanair_reviews %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      .cols = starts_with("Rating"),
      .fns = list(min = ~ min(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                  max = ~ max(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
      .names = "{col}_{fn}"  # append function name ({fn}) to each column name
    )
  ) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

<br>

## Summary

Although there are alternative approaches to coding the examples above, `across()` is an attractive function for creating scalable and easy-to-read code to transform multiple columns in a dataframe.
